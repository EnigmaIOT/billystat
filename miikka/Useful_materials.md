Badly written but useful for gaining some general understanding. Yolov2 guide used to learn about labeling tools before we found Yolo_mark.

https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Amazing work by AlexeyAB, the instructions for some parts are a bit hard to comprehend, because some things are written for Windows and some for Linux, but still a very useful guide. Also clued us in to Yolo_mark

It could be worth trying to clone AlexeyABs version of darknet, and see if it changes anything.
