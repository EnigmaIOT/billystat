## Setting up environment for YOLOv3
***(Laptop users attention: Getting your discrete gpu to work will be a driver-nightmare)***

### Setting up server
#### Creating access point for remote work

Config changes on 01-network-manager-all.yaml

    network:
    ethernets:
       enp1s0:
         addresses: [192.168.1.2/24]
         gateway4: 192.168.1.1
         nameservers:
           addresses: [1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8]
         dhcp4: no
     version: 2

And on our router we enabled port-forwarding to a desired port.

## Installations
### Nvidia drivers
First off we'll download NVidia drivers, let's start by adding nvidia ppa:latest,

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
    sudo apt-get update

Install Nvidia drivers, (NOTE! At the time of writing, Cuda 10 FORCES 410 drivers. Meaning, if you have 415 or newer drivers installed, they will be uninstalled and replaced with 410 drivers. With some work this can be avoided, but you can just reinstall the newer drivers afterwards if necessary.)

    sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-410

And reboot

    sudo reboot
    
### CUDA installation

Head on to the [download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1804&target_type=debnetwork), download the needed file and proceed with instructions.

    sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1804_10.0.130-1_amd64.deb
    sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cuda

We had trouble with apt-get so we used **aptitude**.

    sudo apt-get install aptitude
    sudo aptitude install cuda

Reboot and try out nvidia-smi

    nvidia-smi

    workon facecourse-py3
    
**Test with Python3**

    python removeRedEyes.py
    // Exit virtual environment with deactivate
    deactivate

### Installing Darknet

	git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet.git
	cd darknet
	make
	# No errors? Continue with running ./darknet

	./darknet
	# Output should look like:
	# usage: ./darknet <function>

Edit the Makefile in the base directory to get Darknet to use your CUDA/GPU:

	GPU=1

Also change the 2nd line of the Makefile:

	OPENCV=1
	# Try it with:
	# ./darknet imtest data/eagle.jpg

### Installing Nextcloud for cloud-storage with docker-compose

We decided to use docker-compose to create a container that runs Nextcloud so that we could easily share our training material (pictures/video). 

	cd
	mkdir nextcloud
	nano nextcloud/docker-compose.yml

We need a docker-compose.yml that looks like this,

	version: '3'

	volumes:
	  nextcloud:
	  db:

	services:
	  db:
	    image: mariadb
	    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW
	    restart: always
	    volumes:
	      - db:/var/lib/mysql
	    environment:
	      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
	      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
	      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
	      - MYSQL_USER=username

	  app:
	    image: nextcloud
	    ports:
	      - 8080:80
	    links:
	      - db
	    volumes:
	      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
	    restart: always

Then just run docker-compose,

	sudo docker-compose up -d
	
Now we have Nextcloud running on our project-machine.

### Nextcloud client for easy syncing

To get our material easily synced between our machines we got ourselves the [Nextcloud client](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients). We downloaded the Linux AppImage, changed permissions and ran it.

	chmod +x Nextcloud-2.5.1-x86_64.AppImage
	./Nextcloud-2.5.1-x86_64.AppImage

We added our Nextcloud path which to sync with.

	192.0.1.2:5050 #This is just an example-address and port-numbers
	
This way we all have the same material at all times and synchronized.

## Training your neural networks

### Creating training material

#### Resizing images

To resize the images to a smaller size we made a script that does it for us, let's call it *resize.sh*:

	FOLDER="/path/to/images"

	WIDTH=800

	HEIGHT=600

	find ${FOLDER} -iname '*.jpg' -exec convert \{} -verbose -resize $WIDTHx$HEIGHT\> \{} \;

Run it,

	./resize.sh # Or bash resize.sh, make sure you have x-rights correct
#### 1st Alternative: YOLO-Annotation-Tool

We went to a Pool & Snooker Bar called Corona and got some footage for our project.

Next we used [YOLO-Annotation-Tool](https://github.com/ManivanananMurugavel/YOLO-Annotation-Tool) to create training sets for YOLO.

	git clone https://github.com/ManivannanMurugavel/YOLO-Annotation-Tool.git
	
	cd YOLO-Annotation-Tool

Move our images to the 001 directory under ./YOLO-Annotation-Tool/Images .

	mv ./SnookerData/*.jpeg ./YOLO-Annotation-Tool/Images/001/

We need to remove the cat photos that are in the 001 directory which are all .jpg files.

	cd ./YOLO-Annotation-Tool/Images/001
	rm *.jpg

Next convert our .JPEG files to .JPG files

	mogrify -format jpg *.jpeg

To be able to run main.py we needed a few packages from apt.

	sudo apt-get install python-tk python-pil python-imaging-tk
	sudo pip install Image

Now we should be able to run main.py

	python main.py

The Labeling-Tool looks like this:

![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/19maPfz.gif) 

Although the labeling works well, we wouldn't get the program to run convert.py or process.py succesfully.
It would either create empty files or say that we didn't have some obscure directories (e.g. a directory with the name of our image).


#### 2nd Alternative: Open Labeling

We also tried another labeling-tool called [Open Labeling](https://github.com/Cartucho/OpenLabeling).

	git clone https://github.com/Cartucho/OpenLabeling.git

You can install everything at once by simply running:

	python -mpip install -U pip
	python -mpip install -U -r requirements.txt

Ran the program, shut it down and tried reopening it again and was greeted by Error messages. That was the first and last time we got it to work.

#### 3rd Alternative: Yolo_mark by AlexeyAB

Luckily we found an Annotation Tool called [Yolo_mark](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark)  by the creator of Darknet, AlexeyAB.

First off:

	git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark.git
	cd Yolo_mark

To compile it we ran 3 commands:

	cmake .
	make
	bash linux_mark.sh # Ctrl + C Ends

Set the number of classes (objects) in /x64/Release/yolo-obj.cfg on line 230.
Set filter value in /x64/Release/yolo-obj.cfg on line 224.

* for YoloV3 (classes + 5)*3

Now run Yolo_mark again and start making your BBoxes.

![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/O1JsSZs.gif)

## Actual training - Please note: at the time of writing, this section is still a work in progress. Things may change and put simply, be completely wrong. We are still working out the best settings to yield the best results.
#### Also make sure have your labeling tool ready. We recommend Yolo_mark, it seems to be the best one out there by far.

Let's start by copying and editing our config file:

         cp darknet/cfg/yolov3.cfg ../yolo-obj.cfg

Edit the line **batch** to **batch=64**.

Edit the line **subdivisions** to **subdivisions=64**. If your GPU has lots of memory (over 4GB), you can lower the subdivision number to 32, 16 or even 8.

Edit the line number 610 **classes** to whatever the amount of objects you want to detect is. For example, if you have 10 colors you have 10 classes.

Do the same for lines 696 and 783 as well.

Edit the line number 603 **filters** to whatever your amount of objects + 5 and multiply it by 3. (Objects+5)x3. For example, with 10 objects/classes, the correct filter number would be 45.

Do the same for lines 689 and 776 as well.

After this, create file **obj.names** in your darknet directory.

Write the names of all your objects you want to detect, each in their own line.

For example, if we wanted to detect colors, we would start listing: 1. Green, 2. Blue, 3. Yellow, and so on. **Make sure each object is in its own line!**

Next, create file **obj.data**. In it, fill the following information:

         classes= 10 //the number of your objects
         train = train.txt //you can change these paths if your directory structure differs
         valid = train.txt //^
         names = obj.names
         backup = backup/ //this is where backups of weights files are made, every 1000 lines I thin

#### Marking the images

Now comes the boring part. Make sure you have all your teaching material (.jpgs) ready in Yolo_mark/x64/Release/data/img/.

Back up a bit and launch Yolomark in its top directory:

	$ sh linux_mark.sh

![](https://i.imgur.com/Nvoa8j4.jpg)

It's time to start creating boxes. It's long and tedious work, but it needs to be done. You can change the Object ID from the lower slider, the upper slider can be used to browse pictures. Alternatively you can click the next picture from the top of the screen.

When you are done, you should have a text file for each respective .jpg file in Yolo_mark/x64/Release/data/img/. If this is correct, give yourself a tap on the back. 

Copy **obj.data**, **obj.names** and **train.txt** to your main darknet folder. (Or wherever you want, make sure you remember it.)

Now, open **train.txt**, and make sure it contains the location of every image. One image per line. Yolo_mark should create the file, but if you want to change the image location, you can do it here.

Great! Now before we can try training, we still need to download the premade training weights from the official site:

	$ wget http://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74

And now, if you're feeling confident, we can finally attempt training:

	$ ./darknet detector train obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74

If all goes well, you should start seeing lots of numbers:

![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/k3sXNi0.gif)

Is text flashing before your eyes? Great! Do you see lots of -nan? Maybe not great, who knows at this point. This is what we are trying to find out. At the moment of writing, we  believe that some nans are tolerable, but you should start seeing less and less the longer you iterate.

If you run into CUDA memory errors, try editing the **yolo-obj.cfg** file. Worst case scenario, edit subdivions and batch to 64. You can also try editing the image dimensions, however keep in mind that they **must** be divisible by 32. Make a note of the original value in case you need to revert changes.

On an Nvidia GPU, you can open Nvidia X Server Settings to monitor GPU processor usage, as well as memory usage. It seems to be normal for the GPU usage % to jump around when training with Tiny cfg.

Darknet will generate a weights file every 100 iterations until it reaches 1000 iterations, after which a backup will be saved after every 1000 iterations.


## Testing frame difference from video

### Virtualenv

Either use earlier facecourse-py3 virtualenv or create a new one with suiting name.

We created a new one, *billystat*, the same way as the facecourse virtualenv.

	mkvirtualenv billystat -p python3
	workon billystat
	
	pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn ipython
	deactivate

Create symlink
	
	cd ~/.virtualenvs/billystat/lib/python3.6/site-packages
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/cv2.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so cv2.so

### Frame diff from video with grayscale

	workon billystat
	
	python3 billyFRAME.py
	
![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/QO2VE2P.gif)

### Frame diff with color

We changed 

	current_frame_gray = cv2.cvtColor(current_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	previous_frame_gray = cv2.cvtColor(previous_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	
To

	current_frame_color = cv2.cvtColor(current_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
	previous_frame_color = cv2.cvtColor(previous_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

Which results in

![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/uYViSDV.gif)

This is nice but need something a bit different.

## Ball Tracking

We found a nice article by Adrian Rosebrock, the creator of [pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/), where he creates a [Ball tracking-code](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/) with Python3 using OpenCV.

We decided to try it out and see for ourselves how it works out.

We needed to use a different HSV value (Adrian had a greenball) for our red colored snookerballs. We tried swapping the HSV-values with a lot of different red tones and just didn't manage to get it to detect them. Might have been because of our material that was really poor quality.

### Getting more material

So we headed out to [Tapanilan Urheilukeskus](https://tapanilanurheilu.fi/), who let us use their Snooker-tables and space, to film better material for our project. We used a good few hours and racked up about 1300 images and 2Â½ hours of footage. A special thanks goes to [Tapanilan Urheilukeskus](https://tapanilanurheilu.fi/).

### Testing out cv2.HoughCircles

We thought about trying to find round objects from our material by using cv2.HoughCircles.

This actually works in a way but not consistently, below a link to the example.

[cv2.HoughCircles (Imgur)](https://i.imgur.com/qSMCdpg.gif)

## Working with /matias 

## /bookmarks

I've collected good sources and written some of about most useful articles. 

## /custom

This was first attempt to train YOLOv3 weights, not successful.

## /swissair

This was second attempt to train YOLOv3 weights. This time it started to iterate throught files, but without results. Something went wrong during training.

## /snowman

This was third attempt to train YOLOv3 weights. This time also program started to successfully iterate throught files. But because it was really doing something during training, it was so slow, it took about 20 hours to do 2000 iterations with my laptop. And that is why this one also "failed".

## /snooker

At the same time as I tried to work with snowman-detection, we build a completely working YOLOv3 configuration, which ended up with a working weight (which is not perfect).
